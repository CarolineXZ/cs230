cs230 course code



We leveraged the existing githubs and per-trained GPT2 and GPT2-Medium to start with. 
We did modifications, training and fine-tuning on top of them to get our dataset and results. References of the resources we used:

In this github, we simply copy all the code we used into this repo for milestone checkin purpose. We didn't merge the changes with the main repository they belong to. 
The majory of the code are from the source above.
