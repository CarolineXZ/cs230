cs230 course code



We leveraged the existing githubs and per-trained GPT2 and GPT2-Medium to start with. 
We did modifications, training and fine-tuning on top of them to get our dataset and results. References of the resources we used:

https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/model.py 
https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_gpt2.py 
https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT
https://github.com/danielgrittner/nanoGPT-LoRA/blob/master/model.py 

In our github, we simply copy all the code we used from above into this repo for milestone check-in purpose. We didn't merge the changes with the main repository they belong to yet. The majority of the code are from the source above.
